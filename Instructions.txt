Thank you for trying out the latest edition of Xalenda's "Urban Demons" Mod!

INSTRUCTIONS:


To play game as intended:

RUN Game.exe or Urban Demons.exe - both do the same thing.




To fiddle around with the game:

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
= YOU MUST HAVE RPG MAKER VX ACE =
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

Double-click on Game.rvproj2, enjoy seeing the changes made first-hand.
If you try to playtest and the screen fails to load properly:

Find your RPG Maker VX Ace folder
Look for the System folder
Copy the RGSS300.dll file to another place - DO NOT DELETE THIS
Unzip the RGSS301.rar file in the System folder of UDXM, place the file
where your old file was.

Everything should work properly; RGSS301 changes the aspect ratio for the
game and RGSS300 keeps it at 800x600.

I swear, if your game suddenly crashes, the computer turns off, and somehow gains sentience, I am NOT RESPONSIBLE.
